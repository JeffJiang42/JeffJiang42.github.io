It's been a while since I last posted, and a lot has happened over the last few
months. Most notably, I've graduated! I've had a wonderful time at UT these last
4 years, made some invaluable friends, and learned a lot of mathematics.

I'm probably most indebted to my thesis advisor Dan Freed, who has showed me the
ropes to a lot of wonderful geometry, and is one of the biggest reasons I decided to
pursue mathematics further.
<br></br>

Mathematically, the biggest thing that happened this semester was my senior thesis
over Spin geometry and Dirac operators. Picking up where the last post left off,
the remainder of my thesis involved filling in all the gaps in my knowledge in
the theory of principal bundles and connections, then constructing the
Dirac operator over a manifold, and then proving some curvature theorems, along
with a very small introduction to some index theory. The construction of the
Dirac operator on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ involves the construction of a
<b>Clifford bundle</b> $\mathrm{Cliff}(M)$. As a set,
$$\mathrm{Cliff}(M) = \coprod_{p \in M}\mathrm{Cliff}(T_pM, g_p) $$
which gets a topology and smooth structure from local coordinates on $M$. For a
finite dimensional vector space $V$ equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear
form $b : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$, there is a canonical isomorphism
$\mathrm{Cliff}(V,b) \to \Lambda^\bullet(V)$ of the Clifford algebra with the
exterior algebra. Doing this fiberwise, we get a canonical vector bundle isomorphism
$\mathrm{Cliff}(M) \to \Lambda^\bullet(TM)$. Using the Riemannian metric, this gives
an isomorphism $\mathrm{Cliff}(M) \to \Lambda^\bullet(T^\*M)$.This a bundle of algebras
over $M$, so it makes sense to talk of a bundle of modules over $\mathrm{Cliff}(M)$, i.e.
a vector bundle $E \to M$ such that each fiber $E_p$ is a module over
$\mathrm{Cliff}(M)\_p$. Let $E \to M$ be a bundle of $\mathrm{Cliff}(M)$ modules,
equipped with a fiber metric in which Clifford multiplication by an orthonormal frame
of $M$ is an orthogonal transformation, and a covariant derivative $\nabla$ compatible
with this fiber metric. This is often referred to as a <b>Dirac bundle</b>, since
it has all the necessary ingredients to define a Dirac operator. The <b>Dirac operator
</b> of the bundle $E \to M$ is a first order differential operator
$$\mathcal{D} : \Gamma_M(E) \to \Gamma_M(E) $$
defined locally by the coordinate formula
$$\mathcal{D}\psi = \sum_i e_i\cdot\nabla_{e_i}\psi$$
for any orthonormal frame $\{e_i\}$ for $M$.
<br></br>

One of the first examples of a Dirac bundle is the bundle $E =\Lambda^\bullet(T^\*M)$.
The Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ induces an inner product on $E$, and the isomorphism
$\mathrm{Cliff}(M) \to E$ gives $E$ the structure of a bundle of modules over
$\mathrm{Cliff}(M)$. Under this isomorphism, the Dirac operator is the familiar operator
$\mathcal{D} = d + d^\*$, and $\mathcal{D}^2 = \Delta$, where $\Delta$ denotes the
familiar Hodge Laplacian. In general, the Dirac Laplacian $\mathcal{D}^2$ is a zeroth
order perturbation of the connection Laplacian $\nabla^\*\nabla$, which is expressed
by the <b>Weitzenböck formula</b>
$$\mathcal{D}^2 = \nabla^\*\nabla + \sum_{i,j} e_ie_j\cdot R_{e_i,e_j} $$
where $R$ is the curvature transformation of the bundle $E$, and the $e_i$ are an
orthonormal frame for $M$. An immediate corollary of the Weitzenböck formula expresses
the Hodge Laplacian $\Delta$ in terms of the connection Laplacian $\nabla^\*\nabla$.
$$\Delta = \nabla^\*\nabla + \mathrm{Ric} $$
where $\mathrm{Ric}$ is the Ricci transformation obtained by taking the trace of the
curvature transformation of $M$.
<br></br>

Another way to obtain a Dirac bundle is through a Spin manifold. Given an oriented
Riemannian  manifold $(M,g)$, we can ask for a reduction of structure group from $SO\_n$
to $\mathrm{Spin}\_n$, via the double cover $\mathrm{Spin}\_n \to SO\_n$. If $M$ is spin,
such a reduction of structure group exists, giving us the principal
$\mathrm{Spin}\_n$-bundle $\mathcal{B}\_{\mathrm{Spin}}(M) \to M$. Any Clifford module
$S$ becomes a Spin representation by restricting to the action of the Spin group inside
of the Clifford algebra. Then the associated bundle
$\mathbb{S} = \mathcal{B}\_{\mathrm{Spin}}(M) \times\_{\mathrm{Spin}\_n} S$ is a bundle
of modules over $\mathrm{Cliff}(M)$. Equipping the Clifford module $S$ with an
inner product in which the unit vectors in $\mathrm{Cliff}\_n$ acts by isometries then
induces a fiber metric on $\mathbb{S}$, which is also compatible with the Spin connection
on $\mathcal{B}\_{\mathrm{Spin}}(M)$ obtained by lifting the Levi-Civita connection on
$\mathcal{B}\_{SO}(M)$. Putting everything together, this is the necessary data to make
$\mathbb{S}$ a Dirac bundle, so we get a Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}$ on sections of
$\mathbb{S}$. The Weitzenböck formula then gives the following miraculous result:
$$D^2 = \nabla^\*\nabla + \frac{1}{4}\kappa $$
where $\kappa$ denotes the scalar curvature of $M$.
<br></br>

I also managed to learn a little bit of index theory near the end (which is something
I would like to learn more about). The Clifford algebra $\mathrm{Cliff}\_n$ acts
on itself by right multiplication, which induces a left action of $\mathrm{Cliff}\_{-n}$,
making $\mathrm{Cliff}\_n$ a graded left module over $\mathrm{Cliff}\_{-n}$. This gives
the spinor bundle
$\mathcal{B}\_{\mathrm{Spin}}(M) \times_{\mathrm{Spin}\_n} \mathrm{Cliff}\_n$
the structure bundle of graded modules, which induces a grading on the space of
sections. The Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}$ commutes in the graded sense with the
left action, which means the kernel of $\mathcal{D}$ is a finite dimensional Clifford
module (if we black box some elliptic theory). This then determines a K-Theory class
in $KO^{-n}(\mathrm{pt})$, called the <b>index</b> of $\mathcal{D}$. There's a lot
of very deep and interesting theory regarding the indicies of elliptic operators, which
is something I would like to learn more about, having been exposed to it.
