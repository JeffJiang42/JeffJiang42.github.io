So winter break is almost over, and I'll be heading back to Austin soon for
my last semester as an undergrad. It's a bit odd thinking that it will be
over in a few months, but I'm also excited (and very, very anxious) about
going to graduate school.

I haven't really done too much recently. One of the keys on my laptop stopped
working, so I had to get it send it in for repairs and was computerless for a
few days. I used some of the time to read more of Fulton and Harris, and
refamiliarized myself with some topological arguments regarding Lie groups, specifically
concerning discrete subgroups. Before the break ends, I hope to read a bit more out
of Fulton and Harris, and I might take a peek at volume one of Kobayashi and Nomizu
out of curiousity. I will also probably set up repositories for all the LaTeX
for my senior thesis, but that shouldn't take too much time unless I decide to
start typing up preliminary details. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with my
progress this break, but I don't exactly regret taking it easy either.
I think after the stress of all my applications last semester, I was a little
burnt out, so it's good to have some time to recuperate.

Just a short post this time, since nothing too exciting happened, and there isn't
too much to elaborate on. In addition, I don't really have a concrete plan for
what I plan on doing for the near future, so there isn't much to say on that
front either.
