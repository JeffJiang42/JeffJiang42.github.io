These past two weeks have been pretty busy for me. There was a lot
of thinking for my thesis and I gave my last two lectures for the
differential geometry mini course for the math club, one concerning vector
fields and flows, and one concerning differential forms. I think giving
the lectures was a lot of fun! I got to get more experience in giving talks,
and hopefully I taught the participants a thing or two about differential
geometry. That being said, it's nice to have some extra free time, since
preparing notes for the lectures ate up a decent amount of time.

There have been several interesting problems that have popped up over the
last two weeks. For one of them, the inclusions
$\mathbb{R}^{p,q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p+1,q}$ and
$\mathbb{R}^{p,q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p,q+1}$ induce inclusions
$\mathrm{Cliff}(p,q) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Cliff}(p+1,q)$ and
$\mathrm{Cliff}(p,q)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Cliff}(p,q+1)$, which
corresponds to moving either vertically or horizonatally on the "Clifford
Chessboard."

These inclusion maps induces pullback maps $\mathcal{M}(p+1,q) \to \mathcal{M}(p,q)$ and
$\mathcal{p,q+1} \to \mathcal{M}(p,q)$ where $\mathcal{M}(p,q)$ denotes
the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of $\mathrm{Cliff}(p,q)$ modules
under direct sum. The problem was to compute the cokernel of this pullback map.
To do so, we first needed to classify all the irreducible Clifford modules.
From the chessboard (and the knowledge that moving beyond the chessboard
only results in tensoring with $M(n,\mathbb{R})$), we see that an arbitrary Clifford
algebra is either $M(n,\mathbb{F})$ or $M(n, \mathbb{F}) \times M(n, \mathbb{F})$.
where $\mathbb{F}$ is either $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, or $\mathbb{H}$.
In the first case, the Clifford algebra admits a single irreducible module,
which is just $\mathbb{F}^n$ with the usual action of matrices on the left.
In the second case, we get two modules. Both are copies of $\mathbb{F}^n$,
but either the left or right factor acts trivially. This tells us that
the commutative monoid $\mathcal{M}(p,q)$ is either $\mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$ or
$\mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0} \times \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$.

We also then observe that moving up or right one entry in the Clifford
chessboard gives us one of four cases
1. $M(n, \mathbb{F}) \hookrightarrow M(n, \mathbb{F}')$ where
$\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{F}' = \mathbb{C}$ or
$\mathbb{H}$ is the division algebra twice the dimension of $\mathbb{F}$.
2. $M(n,\mathbb{F}) \times M(n,\mathbb{F}) \hookrightarrow M(2n, \mathbb{F})$.
3. $M(n, \mathbb{F}') \hookrightarrow M(2n, \mathbb{F})$ where $\mathbb{F}$ and
$\mathbb{F}'$ are as in the first case.
4. $M(n,\mathbb{F}) \hookrightarrow M(n, \mathbb{F})$.

We can then make the following observations
1. In this case, the irreducible module for $M(n, \mathbb{F}')$ is twice
the dimension of the irreducible module for $M(n, \mathbb{F})$, so the monoid
map is given by $1 \mapsto 2$, so the cokernel is $\mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z}$.
2. The irreducible module for $M(2n, \mathbb{F})$ is $\mathbb{F}^{2n}$,
and $M(n,\mathbb{F}) \times M(n,\mathbb{F})$ injects into $M(2n, \mathbb{F})$
by mapping $(A,B) \in M(n, \mathbb{F})$ into block matrices of the form
$$\begin{pmatrix}
A & 0 \\\\
0 & B
\end{pmatrix}$$
We then see that this decomposes into each of the irreducible modules for
$M(n,\mathbb{F}) \times M(n, \mathbb{F})$, so the monoid map is given by
$1 \mapsto (1,1)$, and the cokernel is $\mathbb{Z}$.

In the last two cases, the irreducible modules for both Clifford algebras
are the same dimension, so the monoid map is given by $1 \mapsto 1$,
so the cokernel is trivial. One interesting thing to note is that
the cokernel is always a group, not just a monoid! I have yet to assemble these
results into a table, but I expect to find some periodicity results as with
the classification of Clifford algebras.

Another interesting problem involved the following question : Given
an isomorphism $V \to W$ of vector spaces, we get an induced isomorphism
of $\mathrm{End}(V) \to \mathrm{End}(W)$. Conversely, given an isomorphism
$\mathrm{End}(V) \to \mathrm{End}(W)$, do we get an isomorphism $V \to W$? In
otherwords, does knowing the endomorphisms of your vector space canonically
identify your vector space? The answer is -- almost! To see why, we
need a small lemma

Every algebra automorphism of $\mathrm{End}(V)$ is conjugation by a linear
automorphism $A \in GL(V)$.

The proof relies on the observation that the unique irreducible
$\mathrm{End}(V)$ module is $V$ with the standard action. Given an algebra automorphism
$\alpha : \mathrm{End}(V) \to \mathrm{End}(V)$, this gives us another irreducible
module $V^\alpha$, which has the same underlying vector space as $V$, but the algebra
action is now given by $M \cdot v = \alpha(M) \cdot v$, where the right hand
side is the standard action. Since there is only one irreducible module,
there exists an isomorphism $A : V^\alpha \to V$ which in particular is
a linear isomorphism $V \to V$ as well. The fact that $A$ is a module isomorphism
implies that for every $M \in \mathrm{End}(V)$, we have that $AM = \alpha(M)A$,
which implies that $AMA^{-1} = \alpha(M)$.

Going back to our original question, the fact that every automorphism is conjugation
gives us a surjection $GL(V) \to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{End}(V))$. The kernel
of this map is the center of $GL(V)$, which are the scalar matrices, giving
us that $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{End}(V))$ is isomorphic to the projective
linear group $PGL(V)$. Then suppose we fix bases for $V$ and $W$, giving
us isomorphisms $\mathbb{R}^n \to V$ and $\mathbb{R}^n \to W$. This also induces
isomorphisms $M(n,\mathbb{R}) \to \mathrm{End}(V)$ and $M(n, \mathbb{R}) \to \mathrm{End}(W)$.
The isomorphism $\mathrm{End}(V) \to \mathrm{End}(W)$ then induces an automorphism
$M(n,\mathbb{R}) \to M(n, \mathbb{R})$, and our original question translates
into asking whether or not this gives us a unique automorphism in $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$,
which we can answer in the negative -- we only get an automorphism up to
scalar ambiguity, since the automorphism group of $M(n,\mathbb{R})$ is $PGL(n,\mathbb{R})$.
