Something that has been on my mind for the last few months is a certain TQFT, so again,
I thought it might be nice to share. Fix a finite group $G$, let $M$ be a smooth
manifold, and $x \in M$. It is well known that there is a bijective correspondence
$$\mathrm{Hom}(\pi\_1(M,x)) \longleftrightarrow \mathsf{Bun}\_G(M, x)$$
where $\mathsf{Bun}\_G(M, x)$ denotes the groupoid of pointed principal $G$ bundles
$(P,p) \to (M,x)$, where the bijection is given by taking the holonomy of a bundle.
If we consider principal bundles up to isomorphism _without_ basepoint, these are in
bijection with maps $\pi\_1(M,x) \to G$ up to conjugation by an element of $G$.

We then define a TQFT $Z : \mathsf{Bord}\_n \to \mathsf{Vect}\_{\mathbb{C}}$ called
the <b>Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT with gauge group</b> $G$. Given a closed $n$-manifold $M$,
define $Z(M) = \mathbb{C}\_G(M)$, where we define $\mathbb{C}\_G$ to be the vector
space generated by all functions $\pi\_0(\mathsf{Bun}\_G(M)) \to \mathbb{C}$.
Then given a bordism $X$ from $M$ to $N$, we need to produce a linear map
$Z(X) : \mathbb{C}\_G(M) \to \mathbb{C}\_{G}(N)$, which we do as follows:
we have the inclusion maps $M \hookrightarrow X \hookleftarrow N$ of $M$ and $N$
onto the bounday $\partial M$, which induce pullback maps
$\mathsf{Bun}\_G(M) \leftarrow \mathsf{Bun}\_G(X) \to \mathsf{Bun}\_G(N)$.
To define $Z(X)(f)$ on a function $f : \pi\_o(\mathsf{Bun}\_G(M)) \to \mathbb{C}$, we
need to define one more thing. Let $Q \to N$ be a principal bundle over $N$. Let
$\mathcal{G}\_Q$ be the <b>groupoid preimage</b> of $Q$, where the objects are
pairs $(P,\varphi)$, where $P\to X$ is a principal bundle, and $\varphi$ is an
isomorphism $P\vert\_N \to Q$, and the morphisms $(P,\varphi) \to (P',\varphi')$
are bundle morphisms $\psi : P \to P'$ such that $\varphi = \varphi' \circ \psi$.
With this in hand, we construct the linear map $Z(X)$. For $f \in Z(M)$, define
$$Z(X)(f)(Q) = \sum_{(P,\varphi) \in\pi\_0(\mathcal{G}\_Q)}
\frac{f(P\vert\_M)}{|\mathrm{Aut}(P,\varphi)|} $$
I've heard this described to me as some sort of categorified Fourier transform, where
given a function over $M$, we pull it back to a function over $X$, convolve with some
integral kernel, and integrate to push down to $N$. The summation supposed to be
integration along the fiber, but is a sum since $G$ is finite.

The $2$-dimensional version of this TQFT has been on my mind for a while. It is
well known that the $2$ dimensional TQFTs are classified by commutative Frobenius
algebras, and I've been trying to unpack what the algebra here is. I know
it's supposed to be the center of the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[G]$, but have been
getting tripped up over some orbit-stabilizer arguments for computing the order of
automorphism groups.
